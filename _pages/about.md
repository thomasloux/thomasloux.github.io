My name is Thomas Loux and I am a student at Ecole polytechnique, currently following the MVA Master's Degree (Mathematiques, Vision, Apprentissage) at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. I am interested in deep learning and particularly its applications in health (proteins, medical imaging, etc.). I previously interned at the Shakhnovich Group at Harvard University, where I worked on protein complex binding free energy prediction using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning. I also interned at Pretto, a French fintech startup, where I worked on AI software engineering projects. You can find more information about my education and experience on my [CV](/cv/).
