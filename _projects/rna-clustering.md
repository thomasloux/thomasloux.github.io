RNA are essential molecules in the cell, playing a key role in the translation of the genetic code into proteins. They can fold into complex structures that are generally modelled as planar graphs, a graph where the nodes are connected by edges that do not cross each other, called the secondary structure.\\

For bioinformatician, analysis of large RNA databases is a common task, with the goal of clustering similar RNA structures to find different conformations of the same RNA. A K-Means Clustering using a precomputed distance, the base-pair distance (Symetic difference of the set of edges). This is a computationally expensive task as the distance matrix is of size $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of RNA.\\

A strategy is to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the RNA secondary structure that captures the essential information for clustering using a GNN. K-Means clustering is then linear in the number of RNA.\\

**PyTorch Geometric** is used to implement and train the GNN. The model used is a **Residual Gated Graph Convolutional Network** with a distance loss:

$$
    \mathcal{L}_{distanceLoss} = (\Delta(E_1, E_2) - ||\mathbf{X}_{1,pool} - \mathbf{X}_{2, pool} ||)^2
$$

where $\Delta(E_1, E_2)$ is the base-pair distance between the two RNA, $\mathbf{X}_{1,pool}$ and $\mathbf{X}_{2, pool}$ are the pooled embeddings of the two RNA.\\
